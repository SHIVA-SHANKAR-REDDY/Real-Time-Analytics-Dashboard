## Components

### Backend

The backend is built using Node.js and provides APIs to serve data to the frontend. It includes:

- `app.js`: Main application file that sets up the server.
- `routes/`: Defines the API endpoints.
- `controllers/`: Contains the logic to handle requests and responses.

### Frontend

The frontend is developed with React and presents the data in a user-friendly dashboard. It includes:

- `public/`: Static assets and HTML template.
- `src/`: Contains React components and main application files.
  - `components/`: Reusable React components.
  - `App.js`: Main React application component.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.

### Data Processing

Data processing is handled by Python scripts that manage data ingestion and processing tasks. It includes:

- `data_ingestion.py`: Script for ingesting data from various sources.
- `data_processing.py`: Script for processing and preparing data for the dashboard.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies needed for data processing.

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It helps to set up and manage the development environment.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SHIVA-SHANKAR-REDDY/real-time-analytics-dashboard.git
   cd real-time-analytics-dashboard
   ```

2. **_Backend Setup:_**
   Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
```

3. **_Frontend Setup:_**
   Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

4. Data Processing Setup:
   Navigate to the data-processing directory and install Python dependencies:

```bash
cd data-processing
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **_Run the project using Docker Compose:_**

```bash
cd ..
docker-compose up
```

This command will build and start all containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

Usage
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the dashboard.
Ensure the backend server is running and accessible.
Data processing scripts should be executed periodically or triggered as needed.
